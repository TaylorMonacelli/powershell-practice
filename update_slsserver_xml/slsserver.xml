		* actl3trans - absolute path to the ACT-L3 transcoder.exe.
		Example: actl3trans="c:\SLS_DB\actl3trans\transcoder.exe"

		* act_port - for cases where sls.exe and mobile devices
		can't activate with activation server over port TCP/80,
		you can set act_port to use a different port other than
		80.  If act_port is not defined in <storage/> element,
		then activatin will go over TCP/80 by default.

		We've seen cases where although
		$ telnet {activation server IP} 80

		seems to succeed, still sls.exe can't communicate
		properly with activation server as though something is
		mangling the TCP/80 connection.
		Example: act_port="85"
		Here sls.exe would try to activate using TCP port 85.

		* archive - If this boolean is "yes" then store ACT-L3 streams
		to the folder specified by the 'path' parameter.  If no, dont
		store.  Example: archive="yes"

		* convert_amt - The overall maximum number of trascoders
		allowed to run simultaneously.  By transcoders here we
		mean not just Streambox transcoder.exe, but all the
		others including (mencoder.exe, mplayer.exe, ffmpeg.exe,
		transcoder.exe, others?).

		* flash_amount - limit the number of simultaneous processes
		that can create flash files.  Example: flash_amount="10"

		* flash_max - Example: flash_max="600"

		* frames - The maximum number of frames to generate for Flash.
		Example: frames="1000"

		* frames_thumb - The number of images that mplayer should
		create from the quicktime mov file.  Range [1,frames] (see the
		frames parameter).  If frames_thumb is greater than frames,
		then sls.exe will cut the MOV off at the same value of frames,
		therefore frames_thumb range is [1,frames].  Example
		frames_thumb="50"

		* limiter - The maximum number of instances sls.exe
		allows of the Streambox transcoder.exe process to run
		simultaneously.  If limiter is not listed in this
		config, then default value is 2.

		* meta - yes/no.  Default value is meta="yes" if its not
		specified.  meta="no" means sls.exe doesn't wait for a
		metadata packet. It registers stream immediately after
		any packet comes.

		It's a workaround that helps very old encoders to be
		processed as soon as possible.

		* nopic - The image to display before the thumbnail has been
		created by mplayer.  This file must exist in the web
		$docroot/ls directory.  Example: nopic="nopic2.jpg"

		* path - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.
		'webpath' and 'path' are the same values now, so you should
		set 'path' equal to the same value as 'webpath'.  This is
		legacy.  Originally 'webpath' and 'path' meant something
		different, but now they're the same.  Example:
		path="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"

		* preview - Example:
		preview="c:\SLS_DB\wrappers\mcwrap_mov_flv.cmd"

		* thumb - The comandline used to generate frames for the thumbnail.  Example:
		thumb="C:\SLS_DB\wrappers\extract_frame.cmd &quot;C:\SLS_DB\wrappers&quot;"

		* thumb_amount - limit the number of simultaneous process to
		create thumbnails.  Example: thumb_amount="20"

		* thumb_max - The maximum number of seconds to allow the
		thumbnail to be created.  The purpose of this is to prevent
		mplayer hanging from stopping the thumbnial generation
		workflow.  So, for example, if mplayer hangs for longer than
		thumb_max seconds, then sls.exe will kill off the mplayer
		process.  Example: thumb_max="300"

		* webpath - The absolute path to store Streambox media files.
		'webpath' and 'path' are the same values now, so you should
		set path equal to the same value as webpath.  This is legacy.
		Originally 'webpath' and 'path' meant something different, but
		now they're the same.  Example:
		webpath="c:\Apache\htdocs\ls\actl3files"
